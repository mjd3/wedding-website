        Your presence is present enough. Seriously. But for the stubborn among you, we simply ask that you don't bring boxed gifts
        since we will be so far from home!

          <a href="https://kalutara.anantara.com" target="_blank">Anantara Kalutara</a> and that’s where you’ll be staying
          as well. We're very excited about the place and would love to tell you a little about it:
          <br>
          <br> The Anantara Kalutara is a Geoffrey Bawa property. Who is Geoffrey Bawa you ask? He was an iconic Sri Lankan
          architect known for this signature "Tropical Modernism" style, defined by sunlit, breezy structures that meld into
          their natural surroundings. At the Anantara Kalutara, that means a lagoon on one side of the hotel and an ocean
          on the other. The resort has beach access as well as 2 pools.

          <strong>Visas</strong>
          </br>
          Good news! It's super easy to get a short stay visa for Sri Lanka. Simply fill out
          <a href="https://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/center.jsp?locale=en_US#" target="_blank">this form</a>. You should
          receive an approval within 24-48 hours. Be sure to print that out and bring it with you!
          </br>
          </br>
          <strong> Arriving in Sri Lanka</strong>
          </br>
          Fly into Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) - Kalutara is about 1.5 hours away by road. If you plan to arrive before
          the 16th or leave after the 19th, see our FAQ section for vetted transportation providers you can use to hire a
          car and driver. You can also hire them to travel around Sri Lanka.
          <br>
          <br> If you're arriving on the 16th or 17th, or leaving for the airport on the 19th, we will be providing transportation
          to/from the airport.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong> Local SIM Cards</strong>
          </br>
          The resort has WiFi but if you would like to get a local SIM card, you can do so at the airport. The rates are very reasonable
          and they fit your phone with a sim right there so its fairly easy. We recommend this option if you plan to travel
          around Sri Lanka before or after the wedding.
